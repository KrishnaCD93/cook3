# Welcome to my cookbook project

This open source project demonstrates basic two Ethereum smart contract use cases, 
modified for creating and sharing recipes. Sharing recipes will require that the 
recipe be on the blockchain and that the user minted the recipe. To view recipes,
users will be required to send a tip of their choosing to the creator. The webapp 
connects to Ethereum wallets and uses the blockchain as the state machine for user profiles.
Cook3 hosts the blockchain code and the cookbook sub folder holds the webapp code.

To run the app, change directory to the cookbook folder.
